# Python_menu
Contact info: Thomasmgaus@gmail.com
This is my tkinter menu that was built for a professor independent of class.

Please note that this was my first time using the Tkinter library. So the code isn't amazing. I have also replaced the file that is read into the menu to Hockey player names, as I am not sure the professor would want me to display the chemical names used in this menu.
